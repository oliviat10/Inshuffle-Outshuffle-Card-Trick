# Inshuffle-Outshuffle-Card-Trick

The user can input a deck size and at which position in the deck they want the top card to end up.
By using the toBitString method to convert the position to its binary value, in combination with utilizing the inShuffle and outShuffle methods to rearrange the cards, the deck's top card will be moved to the user's desired position.

Can be run from the command line after Deck.java and TopCardPlacer.java are compiled with (for example): java TopCardPlacer 30 13
